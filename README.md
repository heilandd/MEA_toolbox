# MEA Analysis Toolbox
This toolbox is intended as a framework for analysing recordings from microelectric arrays. Today only the recording format from Multi channel systems is supported, but this can be easily extended. Also at there is a limitation where only the 60 MEA layout is supported, but this is could also be extented at a later date.   

## Install using source code
This toolbox requires HDF5 package (McsMatlabDataTools ) from Multi Channel Systems, this can be downloaded at www.multichannelsystems.com or installed using the Add-on Explorer in Matlab. When this is done you are ready to run.
#### GUI
    MEA_Analysis_Toolbox.mlapp
#### Terminal based script
    MEA_Toolbox.m


## Install Toolbox as an app
There is also a pre-packaged App installer file that contains the library from Multi Channel Systems and all the source code. This can be installed and managed like a normal Matlab app.
